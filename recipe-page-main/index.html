        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>Beat the eggs:</span> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of
            salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon
            of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Heat the pan</span>: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium
            heat and add butter or oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Cook the omelette</span>: Once the butter is melted and
            bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly
            coat the surface.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Add fillings (optional)</span>: When the eggs begin to set at
            the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your
            chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Fold and serve</span>: As the omelette continues to cook,
            carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook
            for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Enjoy</span>: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if
            needed.
          </li>
